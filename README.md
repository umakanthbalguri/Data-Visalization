Road traffic crash data are useful tools to support the development, implementation, and assessment of highway safety programs that tend to reduce road traffic crashes. Road traffic crash data gathering aims at gaining a better understanding of road traffic operational problems, locating hazardous road sections, identifying risk factors, developing accurate diagnosis and remedial measures, and evaluating the effectiveness of road safety programs across various geographical areas. Furthermore, the data can be visualised and can be used by many agencies and businesses such as: insurance companies to identify previous vehicle history, insurer history; road safety researchers to access traffic crash reliable database; decision makers to develop long-term, state-wide strategic plans for traffic and highway safety; and highway safety administrators to help educate the public. Given the practical importance of vehicle crash data, this project aims to find the following useful insights:
•	From a Road User Standpoint:
o	How many Crashes have been recorded in each county in United States?
o	How many of these crashes have been Fatal?
o	What are the chances of survival of a Pedestrian/Bike-pedestrian survival in a crash when compared to a motor vehicle Occupant? 
o	Have the deaths in US due to Road accidents increases or decrease overtime. Which states have been consistently outperforming and which states have high fatality rate that the road user should be aware of.
•	From the Transport Authorities Standpoint:
o	How many cases/deaths have been recorded in each county. What portion of these have been due to driving under the influence of Alcohol
o	Which brand/make have higher cases of crash? Had there been an improvement over time due to the improvement of safety standards?
o	What is the top-10 and bottom-10 states/counties with highest road crash incidents?
o	What are the major weather conditions leading to road crashes?
o	What are the peak hours for crashes? And is it consistent through the week? Is there a different pattern during the weekends?
o	Which age group is highly involved in road accidents?
•	From a Used Car buyer Standpoint:
o	How many crashes was the vehicle involved in.
o	When did each of the crash take place?
o	Were the accidents major? Did it lead to fatality? 
o	Which location did the accident occur? Was it on a highway or on the local streets? Which county was it and the state ?
